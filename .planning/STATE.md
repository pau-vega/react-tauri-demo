## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Tauri v2 over Capacitor/React Native: testing Rust-based mobile approach
- @tauri-apps/plugin-store for persistence: native key-value, no web API reliance
- Android-first: iOS is v2 scope
- Plugin installation must be manual (not via `tauri add`) due to pnpm workspace bug

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- First Android compile takes 10-30 min — this is expected, not a failure
- `tauri add` command is broken in pnpm workspaces; all plugin installs must be done manually

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| iOS Support | IOS-01 through IOS-04 | v2 scope | 2026-04-15 |
